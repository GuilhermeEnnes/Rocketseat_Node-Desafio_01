The objective of this repository is to practice some fundamentals of node.js, saw it in rocketseat classes.

Here we have an API that:
- Allow to create an task with title and description
- Offers an update route
- Give a list of the tasks already created
- Check a task as completed
- Permit to delete some task from database

There possible to import tasks from a csv file. For that:
- start the server running 'yarn dev' script
- run the script "yarn import_csv"
